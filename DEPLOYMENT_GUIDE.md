## üöÄ Deployment to Digital Ocean

### Prerequisites
- Digital Ocean account
- MongoDB database URL (already configured in environment)
- Supabase storage credentials (for file uploads)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Digital Ocean

In your Digital Ocean App Platform dashboard, configure these environment variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>

# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=30d

# Supabase Storage (for profile photos/videos)
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-supabase-service-key>

# OAuth (if using Google/Apple sign-in)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
APPLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-apple-client-id>

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

### Step 2: Deploy via Git

Your app is configured to deploy automatically from Git:

1. **Push to your repository** (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Phase 1 deployment ready"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Digital Ocean will automatically:**
   - Detect Node.js 20.x
   - Install dependencies via `npm install`
   - Start the server with `node src/index.js` (from Procfile)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:

#### Health Check
```bash
GET https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/api/v1/health
```

#### User Registration
```bash
POST https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "name": "Test User",
  "role": "CANDIDATE"
}
```

#### User Login
```bash
POST https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/api/v1/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}
```
