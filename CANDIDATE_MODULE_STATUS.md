# Candidate Module Status Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL

## Summary
The candidate module has been fully migrated from Prisma ORM to MongoDB native driver syntax. All critical bugs have been resolved, including a major access control issue that prevented candidates from uploading photos and videos.

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Access Control Bug Fixed** (BLOCKER RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Candidates couldn't upload profile photos or videos  
**Root Cause:** `/api/v1/web/profile` endpoint middleware restricted access to recruiters only  
**Fix:** Changed middleware from recruiter-only to allow all authenticated users  
**Impact:** Candidates can now upload photos and videos to their profiles

### 2. **Video Upload Limit Increased**
**Previous:** 10MB limit  
**New:** 100MB limit (supports ~5 minute videos)  
**Updated:** Both candidate and recruiter dashboards

### 3. **MongoDB Syntax Conversion**
All candidate controllers converted from Prisma to MongoDB native driver:
- ✅ `updateUserProfile.js` - Profile photo/video uploads
- ✅ `uploadOnboardingMedia.js` - Onboarding media uploads
- ✅ `getOnboardingMedia.js` - Retrieve uploaded media
- ✅ `respondToJobOffer.js` - Accept/decline job offers

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Safe ID Handling
Added defensive helper functions to handle various ID formats:

```javascript
// In respondToJobOffer.js
const toObjectId = (value) => {
  if (!value) return null;
  if (value instanceof ObjectId) return value;
  if (typeof value === 'object') {
    const idValue = value._id || value.id;
    return idValue ? (idValue instanceof ObjectId ? idValue : new ObjectId(String(idValue))) : null;
  }
  return new ObjectId(String(value));
};
```

```javascript
// In updateUserProfile.js
const serializeId = (value) => {
  if (!value) return null;
  if (value instanceof ObjectId) return value.toString();
  if (typeof value === 'object' && (value._id || value.id)) {
    const id = value._id || value.id;
    return id instanceof ObjectId ? id.toString() : String(id);
  }
  return String(value);
};
```

### MongoDB Query Patterns

**Before (Prisma):**
```javascript
const userData = await userModel.findById(userId, {
  matchMedia: true,
  transcriptions: {
    where: { user: { is: { id: req.token.sub } } },
    select: { mediaId: true, text: true }
  }
});
```

**After (MongoDB):**
```javascript
const userData = await userModel.findById(userId);
const transcriptions = await transcriptionModel.findMany({
  userId: new ObjectId(userId)
});
```

## Testing Results

### Server Status
✅ Server running without errors  
✅ MongoDB connection successful  
✅ All routes properly mounted  

### File Upload Functionality
✅ Photo upload working (up to 5MB)  
✅ Video upload working (up to 100MB / ~5 minutes)  
✅ Proper file type validation  
✅ Supabase storage integration working  

### Access Control
✅ Candidates can now access `/web/profile` endpoint  
✅ Recruiters still have access (no regression)  
✅ Proper authentication checks in place  

### Database Operations
✅ No more Prisma syntax errors  
✅ ObjectId conversions working correctly  
✅ Safe ID extraction prevents runtime errors  
✅ Nested object handling robust

## Files Modified

### Controllers
- `src/controllers/web/updateUserProfile.js` - Profile photo/video upload
- `src/controllers/web/index.js` - Middleware configuration
- `src/controllers/candidate/uploadOnboardingMedia.js` - Onboarding uploads
- `src/controllers/candidate/getOnboardingMedia.js` - Retrieve media
- `src/controllers/candidate/respondToJobOffer.js` - Job offer responses

### Frontend
- `public/candidate/dashboard.html` - Video size limit updated to 100MB
- `public/recruiter/dashboard.html` - Video size limit updated to 100MB

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Simplified Responses
Some endpoints now return flatter data structures without deeply nested Prisma-style relations. This is intentional for MongoDB compatibility.

### 2. Transcription Feature
The onboarding media transcription feature requires Python and FFmpeg, which may not work in all deployment environments.

### 3. Notification System
The job offer notification system has been simplified - complex Prisma relations removed for MongoDB compatibility.
