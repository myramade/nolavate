---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Base Model Enhancement
- ✅ Added `findManyAnd()` method for MongoDB $and queries

### 2. Controller Conversions (Prisma → MongoDB)
- ✅ **getProspects.js** - Prospects listing
- ✅ **getMyMatches.js** - Matches listing
- ✅ **getPostByUser.js** - Job posts by user
- ✅ **createCompany.js** - Company creation with file upload
- ✅ **createCompanyV2.js** - AI-powered company creation
- ✅ **createSimplePost.js** - Simple job post creation
- ✅ **getMyCompany.js** - Company profile retrieval

### 3. Critical ObjectId Conversions
All user IDs, company IDs, and post IDs from JWT tokens are now properly converted to ObjectId before database queries:
```javascript
// Before (silent failures)
query.recruiterId = req.token.sub;

// After (working)
query.recruiterId = new ObjectId(req.token.sub);
```

## Testing Results

### Server Status
✅ Server running without errors  
✅ MongoDB connection successful  
✅ All routes properly mounted at `/api/v1/*`  

### Database Queries
✅ No more "is not a function" errors  
✅ No more silent query failures from ID type mismatches  
✅ Proper ObjectId handling throughout recruiter module  

### API Responses
✅ Endpoints return proper JSON responses  
✅ Error handling in place for missing data  
✅ Empty states handled correctly  

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Complex Nested Queries Simplified
Some endpoints now return simplified data structures instead of deeply nested Prisma-style relations. This was necessary for MongoDB compatibility but shouldn't affect basic functionality.

### 2. Metrics Endpoint
The `/api/v1/web/metrics` endpoint still contains complex Prisma queries with nested selects. It may not work perfectly but is not critical for core recruiter workflows.

### 3. Email Service Not Configured
The forgot password feature shows reset links in server console logs instead of sending emails (as intended for Replit environment).

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Data Population Lookups**: Restore nested company/user data in responses by adding manual MongoDB lookups
2. **Optimize Metrics Endpoint**: Convert metrics.js to use MongoDB aggregation pipelines
3. **Add Input Validation**: Add defensive handling for malformed ID parameters
4. **Frontend Testing**: Test with actual user accounts to verify end-to-end flows
